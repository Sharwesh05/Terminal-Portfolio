# Terminal-Portfolio

This is a simple portfolio design inspired by the aesthetic of a terminal. It features a clean, dark interface with bright text, mimicking the classic look of command-line interfaces. This design is intended to showcase my work in a unique and visually engaging way, making it easy for visitors to navigate through my projects and skills.
